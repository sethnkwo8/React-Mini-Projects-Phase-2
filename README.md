## 📦 Projects

### 1️⃣ Advanced Todo App
- Global state management using `useReducer + Context`
- Performance optimization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
- Custom hooks for state access
- Clean, scalable architecture

📄 See: `projects/project-1-todo/README.md`

---

### 2️⃣ Authentication State App
- Authentication state with `useContext + useReducer`
- Login / Logout flow
- Protected UI logic
- Page-based structure ready for routing

📄 See: `projects/project-2-authstateapp/README.md`

---

## 🚀 Purpose
These projects were built to:
- Strengthen real-world React architecture skills
- Practice performance-aware component design
- Prepare for **React Router, TypeScript, Next.js, and Full Stack React**
